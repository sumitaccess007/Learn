--- SNS Vs SES ---
------------------
- SES, or Simple Email Service, is a scalable and highly available email service, and it's designed to help marketing teams and application developers, send marketing, notification, and transactional emails to their customers using a pay as you go model.
- And with SES, you can send, as well as receive email.
- So it can also be used to receive emails with incoming mails delivered to an S3 bucket.
- And you can also use SES to trigger Lambda and SNS. So incoming emails can be used to trigger Lambda functions and
SNS notifications.
- When would we use SES?
- Well, you can use it to send automated emails. For example, if you wanted to send a notification that there is a new post in a discussion forum that you moderate. You could also use it to send automated emails confirming online purchases, for example, purchase confirmations, shipping notifications, and order status updates.
- And another classic example is automated marketing communications. So advertising, newsletters, special offers, new products, and Black Friday deals.
- So at first it might seem like SES provides a fairly similar service to SNF, but there are some subtle differences which you will need to be aware of.
- So SES is an email messaging service, and it's only email, and it can be used to trigger a Lambda function or an SNS notification.
- It can be used for both incoming or outgoing email, and an email address is all that's required to start sending messages using SES.
- So you can begin spamming your customers immediately, or what I meant to say is that you can begin sending quality marketing messages immediately.
- Whereas SNS is a pub sub or publish and subscribe messaging service, and it supports lots of different formats, including SMS or text message, HTTP, SQS, and email as well.
- SNS notifications can also be used to trigger Lambda functions.
- And with SNS, you can also fan out messages to a large number of recipients.
- So for example, you can replicate messages and push them to multiple endpoints using multiple different formats.
- So it's a much more sophisticated solution than SES. And finally, in order to receive the notifications, consumers need to subscribe to a topic before they can receive the notifications.

--- Exam Tips ---
-----------------
- Remember that SES is for emails only. It can be used to send and receive emails.
- So it can also be used for incoming emails with the incoming emails saved to S3.
- And it is not subscription-based.
- All you need to know is the email address, and then you are good to go to begin sending emails.
- Whereas SNS supports multiple different formats, including SMS, text message, SQS, HTTP, and email.
- SNS is all about push notifications and it's not used for receiving incoming notifications.
- And it uses a pub sub model or publish and subscribe, so consumers need to subscribe to a topic in order to receive the notifications.
- And finally SNS also supports fan out, which means that it can fan out messages to a large number of recipients simultaneously, for example, multiple SQS queues, HTTP endpoints, and email addresses.
- So it's a much more sophisticated solution than SES.
