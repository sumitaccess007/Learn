--- DynamoDB API Calls ---
--------------------------
- So we can use API calls to programmatically interact with our DynamoDB table, for example, to query, delete, or add items.
- When we use the AWS CLI to run the get-item command, we are interacting with the DynamoDB GetItem API.
- And this is the application programming interface that allows us to programmatically interact with DynamoDB. And if the item requested is in the table, it will return it.
- So let's review the most commonly used commands.

--- Create Table Command ---
- So we've got create table, which creates a new table.

--- Add Item to Table ---
- Put-item, which adds a new item into a table or replaces an old item with a new one.

--- Get Data ---
- Get-item returns a set of attributes for an item with a given primary key.

--- Edit Attributes ---
- Update-item allows you to edit the attributes of an existing item, for example, add or delete attributes.

--- Modify a Table ---
- There's update-table, which allows you to modify a table, for example, modify the provisioned throughput settings on the table.

--- List of Tables ---
- There's list-tables, which returns a list of the tables in your account.

- And these all the corresponding API calls. And you'll notice that the API call has a very similar name to the AWS CLI command.

--- Info of a Table ---
- We then have describe-table, which returns information about the table, for example, the current status, the creation date, primary key and indexes, etc.

--- Read Every Item in Table ---
- There's scan, which reads every item in the table and returns all items and attributes.

--- Return Fewer Items ---
- And you can use a FilterExpression if you'd like to return fewer items. So filter out some of the items that you don't want. There's query, which queries the table based on a partition key value that you provide.

--- Delete An Item ---
- Delete-item allows you to delete an item based on its primary key.

--- Delete Table ---
- And delete-table deletes the whole table, including all of its items.

- And these are the corresponding API calls. And hopefully most of these will already be very familiar to you because we've already been using a lot of these commands in this course.
- But also, even when you're using the AWS console to interact with DynamoDB, these are some of the API calls that are being invoked under the hood.
- And you might be wondering, do I need to know all of these commands for the exam? Well, you should understand what they're used for at a high level, understand the differences between them, and also be aware that the user must have the correct identity and access management permissions to run the command in question, because without the right permissions, the command will not work.

--- Example ---
- So let's take a look at an example. Imagine you have a team member who needs to add a new item into a table and replace an old item with a new one. They will need to run the put-item CLI command, which uses the PutItem API, and they will need identity
and access management permissions to call PutItem.

- For more information, there is the official AWS command-line reference, and this lists all of the available commands, as well as how to use each one and some examples as well. And there's a link to this page in the Resources for this lesson. So it's there if you need it.
- But you do not need to memorize command syntax or options for each command.


-----------------
--- Exam tips ---
-----------------
- The main thing that you need to know is how you would use each of the common commands listed in this lesson, so when to use each command and what they are used for. You do not need to memorize command syntax.
- Understand that the CLI commands are making calls to the DynamoDB API and that the correct identity and access management permissions are required in order to successfully make an API call.
- For example, if you want to run the get-item command to return a set of attributes for a specific item, you are using the GetItem API call, and you will need the correct identity and access management permissions to allow you to run the GetItem API call.
