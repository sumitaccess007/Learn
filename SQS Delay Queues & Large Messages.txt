--- SQS Delay Queues and Managing Large Messages in SQS ---
-----------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------
--- SQS Delay Queues? ---
-------------------------
- Well, these allow you to postpone the delivery of new messages in SQS. So you can postpone the delivery to a queue for a number of seconds.
- And this means any messages sent into the delay queue actually remain invisible to any consumers of the queue for the duration of the delay period which you set.
- And the default delay for a delay queue is zero seconds. And the maximum is 900 seconds, which is 15 minutes.
- So for standard SQS queues, this doesn't affect the delivery or the visibility of any messages which are already in the queue. It's only going to affect new messages arriving in the queue.
- However, if it's a FIFO queue, this is going to affect the delay of any message which is already in the queue.

--- So when should you use a Delay Queue? ---
- Well, with large distributed applications, you might need to introduce a delay in processing, somewhere along the line for your application.
- You might even need to apply a delay to an entire queue of messages.
- For example, imagine an online retail application where you might want to introduce a delay of a few seconds, in order to allow for updates to a sales or stock control database, before sending out notifications to your customers confirming an online transaction.

- So for delay queues, the main thing that you need to know is what they are and what they can be used for.
- So just remember they can be used to delay or postpone the delivery of new messages in SQS.


--------------------------------------
--- Managing large messages in SQS ---
--------------------------------------
- While the best practice for managing large SQS messages is to actually use S3, and when we say large SQS messages, I mean messages which are 256 kilobytes and up to two gigs in size.
- So the main thing to remember is that you can use S3 to store these messages, but in order to do that, there's a couple of things you're going to need to also configure.
	- So first of all, you're going to need the Amazon SQS Extended Client Library for Java, and this is going to allow you to manage the messages when they're in S3.
	- And you'll also need the AWS SDK for Java, as well. And that just provides an API for the S3 bucket and object operations, so it's that SDK which allows you to get, and put, and delete objects from the S3 bucket.
- So in order to use S3 to store your messages, you're actually going to need both of those, both the Extended Client Library and also the SDK for Java.
- So the SQS Extended Client Library for Java, it allows you to specify that messages are either always stored in S3, or only the messages over a certain size, for example, only the messages over 256 kilobytes.
- It also allows you to send a message referencing a message object which is stored in S3, and also get and delete message objects from S3.
- Now, you don't need to know how to set this up for the exam. The main thing that you need to know for the exam is that when you're dealing with large messages in SQS, it's really useful to be able to store them in S3, and for that, you're going to need the AWS SDK for Java, the SQS Extended Library for Java, of course you're going to need an S3 bucket as well. And you can't just use the normal AWS CLI, you can't do it using only the console, the AWS Management Console, or the SQS Console. You can't do this using just the SQS API or any of the other AWS SDKs,
- so just remember the things that you're going to need to use in order to manage your large SQS messages.

--- Exam Tips ---
-----------------
- You can use the SQS delay queue if you need to postpone the delivery of new messages.
- Messages in your delay queue remain invisible for the duration of the delay period. And it's zero by default, up to 900 seconds or 15 minutes.
- And you can use delay queues for large distributed applications, which might need to introduce a delay in processing, in order to avoid errors in the application.
- And for managing large messages in SQS, just remember our exam tips, so if you have large messages up to two gig, store them in S3.
- And in order to do that you're going to need to have a S3 bucket, and you'll also need to use the AWS SDK for Java, as well as the SQS Extended Client Library for Java, as well.
- And just remember, you can't do this using the regular AWS CLI or the Management Console, or the SQS API.
